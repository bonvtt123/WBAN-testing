## Project Description:

### Overview:

This prototype project explores the potential of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) for real-time health monitoring by using advanced wearable technology. The hardware base includes a Google Pixel 6 and a Fitbit Versa 2, which are employed to collect vital health metrics such as heart rate and steps taken. The software component of the project is structured into phone and server codes which facilitate data processing and analysis.

### Code components:
- Fitbit environment code (Javascript):

  -  App (index.js): designs for watches app, collecting data when recieve request from the phone.

  - Companion (index.js): runs on the smartphone, handling data collection and sending request.
    
  - package.json: 

- Sever code(Python):

  - Scaler.pkl: This file contains the scaler information used for normalizing the data before predictions.

  - Prediction model: Pre-trained model file to predict the next 5 minute data (13 dimensions each).

  - sever.py: Responsible for running the prediction model and implementing proposed sampling algorithm to process the data.
 


### Data return:

Data item in list 1-12: heart rate data  , 13: step counts

### Implementation: 

At the beginning of every prediction window of 5 minutes (ùëõ = 5),
the server predicts the next 5 data, runs sampling algorithm to select sampling epochs (each of 1
minute) in this window and sends the decision to the phone via
WiFi. The phone then sends a sampling request to FitBit at the
beginning of each selected sampling epoch via Bluetooth. When requested, FitBit reports the collected sample at the end of the epoch,
which is then buffered at the phone and sent back to the server
together with other collected samples at the end of the window.

## Getting started:
### Running the sever (Python):
1. Replace the path for prediction model and scaler with your path
2. in the termial type:
`py sever.py`
### Set up Fitbit Environment (JavaScript):
Read about setting up your environment at: https://dev.fitbit.com/getting-started/

**Important:**

- For Fitbit Versa 2, use `npx create-fitbit-app myVersa2Project --sdk-version 4.3.0` instead of `npx create-fitbit-app myVersa2Project` to have correct version

- Include the companion file when set up your envinronment

### Prepare the app:
Replace the content of app and companion file, package.json with the new content 
###  Installing the app in Phone Fitbit app:
If you're using a Fitbit device, you need to enable the Developer Bridge. On the watch, go to Settings and tap Developer Bridge, then wait until it says Connected to Server.

NOTE: WiFi must be configured on the device. The first connection attempt can take up to 20 seconds before it's fully established, but subsequent attempts should be instantaneous.

The simulator or device should now be connected to the developer bridge.

Now type:

`npx fitbit`

This will launch the interactive Fitbit Shell and your command prompt should now display fitbit$.

From the Fitbit Shell, type `bi` to build and install the app .
### Running the app:
The phone will now connect to the sever, and run the prototype.
## More information:
### Change experienment type:
In sever change `switch=0` if you want to collect all the grouth truth data, `switch=1` to only collect the sampling data.
